        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Luke Freeman, I'm currently a senior at Lewis University and I will be graduating in December 2021. I am a double major in Computer Science and Data Science. 
            I have one sister and still live with my parents and my dog Frankie (she's stuck under the table in the picture above this). My sister is an accountant and she lives in Naperville. My mom is an Admin and my dad is an Electrical 
            Engineer. I work for a company called LitePoint, we make electronic testing equiptment. I develop software there to incorporate into the equiptment and calibrate it. When I'm 
            not at work or at school I'm usually working out, riding my longboard, walking my dog, or doing anything else outside or with animals really. 
        </p>

        <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
        <p>I don't have one favorite hobby specifically. I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with my friends but I also like to be 
            outside and hang out with animals. I love shopping and spending money in general as well. I like to longboard and skateboard when it's 
            nice out too. Along witb that, I enjoy getting tattos (I'm not sure if that counts as a hobby or not) and will be getting 3 more in the 
            next few weeks. I will be getting a stegosaurus being lifted up by party balloons, an x-wing from star wars, and a man sitting on top 
            of the moon.

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>My fun fact is that I have a tattoo of a duck riding a skateboard that's named winston church bill on my thigh. He's wearing one of my hats 
            and the shows I was wearing the day I got him done. I mentioned above that I enjoy tattoos, ducks are my favorite animal, and I like to skate, 
            so I put all of them together for this tattoo. I also have a family of ducks colored pride colors around my ankle. There's a picture right below 
            this if you're interested :*]
